# AWS-Services_RealTimeFlightDataProcessing
Aviation Stack Flight data processing with AWS services

Problem: user and decision maker gets the updated data after 24 hours and by that time itâ€™s too late make decision for important updated data which might be risky for airlines /aircraft / engine or business financial health.

Solution: this architecture is designed/developed to get the updated data within a given interval like 30 minute or an hour for each flight flying in the sky or grounded at the airport.

Step by Step Process Flow:

1)- API- lambda runs for real time flight, cities, airplanes and aircraft types and get data from Aviation stack .
2)- data get pushed to respective api stream and each stream has only 1 shard.
3)- once data pushed to stream then it gets consumed by kinesis firehose as per stream.
4)-kinesis has 300 seconds buffer time and data gets stored in S3
5)-once data loaded in s3 then we run glue spark every hour for flight data and once in day for Citi, aircraft and airplane data 
6)- lambda and glue runs through cloud watch rules
7)- table produced by glue job can be used in Athena and quickshight for analytics.

Deployment_Lambda.zip: this zip file contains all the lambda python scripts and required python libraries to execute the lambda function in aws console. This is uploaded in s3 under bucket kinesis-producer-lambdas below are the list of python script used in lambda.

Name of the python scripts:
Aircraftstream.py: this is being used in aircarftstreamlambda lambda function which will push aircraft data into the stream.
Airplanestream.py: this is being used in airplanestreamlambda lambda function, which will push airplane data into the stream
Citistream.py: this is being used in citistreamlambda lamda function, which will push city data into the stream
Flightstream.py: this is being used in flightstreamlambda lambda function, which will push flight data into the stream
